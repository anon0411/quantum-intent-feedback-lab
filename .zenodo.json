  "description": "This research experimentally demonstrates that quantum circuits can adapt and evolve their structure through observation-based feedback. The paper introduces a feedback mechanism called 'Quantum Intent Feedback' and presents five simulation experiments using Qiskit. Results show that structural mutation and intent reinforcement are distinguishable from chaotic noise. \n\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad00\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcc0\ud615\uacfc \uc790\uae30 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
